  # Fix RLS Policies for Insert Operations

  1. Security Updates
    - Drop existing restrictive policies
    - Create new policies that allow INSERT operations for authenticated users
    - Ensure all tables have proper INSERT policies
    - Add policies for SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE operations as well

  2. Tables Updated
    - products: Allow all operations for authenticated users
    - customers: Allow all operations for authenticated users  
    - sales: Allow all operations for authenticated users
    - purchases: Allow all operations for authenticated users
    - ai_insights: Allow all operations for authenticated users
